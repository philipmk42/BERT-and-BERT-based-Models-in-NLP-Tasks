BERT and BERT-based Models in NLP Tasks
About Me
Hi, I'm Your Name, a developer passionate about natural language processing and machine learning. This project showcases my work in implementing and analyzing BERT-based models for core NLP tasks using a Streamlit application. Connect with me on GitHub or via email to discuss this project or potential collaborations!
Project Overview
This Streamlit application demonstrates the implementation and analysis of BERT and its variants (BERT-Base, DistilBERT, ALBERT) for three core NLP tasks: Sequence Classification (Sentiment Analysis), Token Classification (Named Entity Recognition - NER), and Question Answering (Extractive QA). The app allows users to interact with the models via text inputs, view predictions, automatic evaluations (e.g., Accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall), and human evaluations (Fluency, Coherence, Relevance), and visualize results using bar charts.
Features

Model Descriptions: Overview of BERT-Base, DistilBERT, and ALBERT, including architecture, pre-training objectives (e.g., MLM, NSP, SOP), fine-tuning datasets (SST-2, CoNLL-2003, SQuAD), and applications.
Interactive Tasks:
Sequence Classification: Analyze sentiment in text (e.g., movie reviews), outputting POSITIVE or NEGATIVE with confidence scores.
Token Classification: Extract entities (e.g., Person, Location, Organization) from user-provided sentences.
Question Answering: Extract answers from a context paragraph based on a user-provided question.


Evaluations:
Automatic metrics: Accuracy/F1 for classification, Precision/Recall/F1 for NER, Exact Match/F1 for QA.
Human evaluation: Sliders (1–5 scale) for Fluency, Coherence, Relevance, with averaged scores visualized.
Bar charts comparing model performance for automatic and human metrics.


Comparison Table: Summarizes model strengths (e.g., contextual understanding) and limitations (e.g., computational intensity).
Text-based Interaction: No voice input/output, ensuring simple and accessible usage.

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bert-nlp-tasks-app.git
cd bert-nlp-tasks-app


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the app:streamlit run app.py

Open your browser at http://localhost:8501.

Usage

Sequence Classification Tab: Enter a movie review (e.g., "This movie was fantastic!") to get sentiment predictions (e.g., "POSITIVE (confidence: 0.95)") and view metrics (Accuracy, F1).
Token Classification Tab: Enter a sentence (e.g., "Barack Obama visited Google's headquarters in California.") to extract entities (e.g., "Barack Obama (PER), Google (ORG), California (LOC)").
Question Answering Tab: Provide a context paragraph (e.g., "Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs...") and a question (e.g., "Who founded Apple Inc.?") to get answers (e.g., "Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne").
Rate outputs using sliders for human evaluation (Fluency, Coherence, Relevance) to generate bar charts comparing models.

Models Used

BERT-Base: Fine-tuned on SST-2 (sentiment), CoNLL-2003 (NER), SQuAD (QA). Robust for general-purpose NLP.
DistilBERT: Lightweight, distilled from BERT-Base, optimized for efficiency.
ALBERT: Parameter-efficient with shared layers, ideal for resource-constrained environments.

All models are sourced from Hugging Face via the transformers library.
Evaluation

Automatic Metrics:
Sequence Classification: Accuracy, F1 (e.g., BERT-Base: ~0.94, DistilBERT: ~0.98).
Token Classification: Precision, Recall, F1 (e.g., ~0.85–0.90 for NER).
Question Answering: Exact Match, F1 (e.g., ~86–90 for SQuAD).
Uses Hugging Face evaluate library on subsets of SST-2, CoNLL-2003, and SQuAD datasets.


Human Metrics: User-rated Fluency, Coherence, and Relevance, averaged and visualized in bar charts.
Results Summary: 
Strengths: BERT’s contextual understanding, DistilBERT’s speed, ALBERT’s efficiency.
Limitations: Computational intensity, potential underperformance on out-of-domain data, subword handling in NER.

Instructions for Uploading to GitHub

Create a GitHub Repository:
Go to GitHub and sign in.
Click "New" to create a repository (e.g., bert-nlp-tasks-app).
Initialize with a README (optional, as you’ll replace it) and choose a license (e.g., MIT).


Prepare Your Project:
Save the provided Streamlit app code (from your previous interactions) as app.py in a project directory (e.g., bert-nlp-tasks-app).
Save this README content as README.md in the same directory.
Create a requirements.txt file with the listed dependencies:streamlit
transformers
datasets
evaluate
torch
pandas
nltk


Optionally, create a LICENSE file for the MIT License (copy from GitHub’s template or elsewhere).


Upload to GitHub:
Initialize a Git repository locally:cd bert-nlp-tasks-app
git init
git add app.py README.md requirements.txt LICENSE
git commit -m "Initial commit with Streamlit app and README"


Link to your GitHub repository:git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/bert-nlp-tasks-app.git


Push to GitHub:git push -u origin main




Verify No Personal Tokens:
The provided README and previous code do not contain personal tokens, API keys, or sensitive information. The Hugging Face models are publicly accessible, and no authentication tokens are embedded.
If you use private Hugging Face models in the future, ensure you don’t hardcode tokens. Use huggingface-cli login locally or environment variables.


Test the App:
After uploading, clone the repository to a new environment, install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt), and run streamlit run app.py to verify functionality.
Test with inputs like:
Sequence Classification: "This movie was fantastic!"
Token Classification: "Barack Obama visited Google's headquarters in California."
Question Answering: Context: "Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs...", Question: "Who founded Apple Inc.?"




GitHub Settings:
Update the repository description on GitHub to match the project overview.
Add topics/tags (e.g., nlp, bert, streamlit, machine-learning) for visibility.
Optionally, set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD or automate dependency installation.
